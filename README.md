# Flask-Web-App
My first full stack website, to use the Flask web framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 

Ideas:  
### Book App
- everyone can log in and make an account 
- uses the New York Times' Books API 
-   search book, check if it is a NYT Best Seller
-   search book, check reviews
- use book display API, maybe 
- can add book to reading list
- can remove book from reading list
- log out

### How to run on local environment: 
- set FLASK_APP=application.py 
- python -m flask run   

With debug mode on: 
- set FLASK_APP=application.py
- set FLASK_DEBUG=1
- python -m flask run

### Files: 
- application.py: Main chunck of program. 
- requirements.txt: other libraries used in app
- static/: static files like images, CSS files, etc.
- templates/: HTML templates
