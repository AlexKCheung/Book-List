# Flask-Web-App
My first full stack website, to use the Flask web framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 

Ideas:  
### Book App
- everyone can log in and make an account 
- uses the New York Times' Books API 
-   search book, check if it is a NYT Best Seller
-   search book, check reviews
- use book display API, maybe 
- can add book to reading list
- can remove book from reading list
- log out


### How to run on local environment: 
Make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your device first! 
https://www.python.org/downloads/  
After downloading python, you can "pip install flask" on the command line in this repository.  
- set FLASK_APP=main.py 
- python -m flask run
