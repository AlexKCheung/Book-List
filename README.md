# Flask-Web-App
My first full stack website, to use the Flask web framework, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 

Ideas:  
### Book App
- everyone can log in and make an account 
- uses the New York Times' Books API 
-   search book, check if it is a NYT Best Seller
-   search book, check reviews
- can add book to reading list
- can remove book from reading list
- log out
