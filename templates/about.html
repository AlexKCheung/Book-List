During the pandemic, I picked up an old hobby of reading.  
After reading several books, I needed an efficient way to keep track of my book reading progress. 
<br>
While there was Amazon's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>, I did not particularly enjoy the interface. 
<br>
Hence, I created Book List, which happens to also be my first full stack website, yet to be deployed in the future.
